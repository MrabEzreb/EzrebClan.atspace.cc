===================
Code repo for my website.
Note: I do not have the site hosted right now. What I do have, however, is a development server.
The development server is subject to a LOT of changes, which may or may not break things, so, I wouldn't sign up at the dev website or anything like that, since I may or may not have to wipe the databases at any point. :P

But, nonetheless, if you want to keep up with the progress, you should do three things:

1. watch/star this repo
2. Check out the dev site
3. I may put out youtube videos about it at some point.

Just remember, the dev server is for development, it's kindof like a beta server, and any private servers that I host myself will be alpha just for me and possibly a select few.

Thanks for reading! Bye!
