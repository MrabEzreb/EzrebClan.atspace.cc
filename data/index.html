                    <h2>What is PHP?</h2>
                    <p>PHP stands for <b>H</b>ypertext <b>P</b>re<b>p</b>rocessor. It is a server-side scripting language.</p>
                    <p>Javascript is a client-side language. When you open up a website with javascript, the javascript gets sent to your browser, and your browser runs it.</p>
                    <p>PHP, however, is server-side. When you open up a website with PHP, the server that is hosting the website runs the php code, and <b>then</b> sends you the html document.</p>
                    <p>Because PHP is server-side, if you view the source of a webpage with PHP, the PHP will not be there. That is because, the purpose of PHP is to do things on the server-side, and those things can include adding content to a webpage. It is impossible to tell if a part of a webpage was created with PHP or actually part of the html file.</p>
                    <p>Because of this nature of PHP, I had an idea. "Hey, what if I wanted to get the current time, but have that be the only thing in a webpage's source." Well, the answer is: PHP!</p>
                    <p>So, I created Ezreb Clan Hosted Data for anyone out there who needs that. When you access the webpage, the PHP code runs before the webpage is sent, and it generates whatever that you need!</p>
                    <p>Thanks for checking it out! :D</p>
